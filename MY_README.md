### Project Review

This was a challenging project but really needed to improve on the skills I have so far, the project used all the technologies I was taught during the academy and
helped me identify where I need to learn further

### Potential Next Steps for the Project

As next steps I would like to implement more of the twitter real app into this project and make it more complex
